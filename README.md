**Python GUI Calculator App**

This is a modern calculator application built using Python (Tkinter).
It performs basic arithmetic operations and supports modulus (%), percentage calculations, and backspace functionality — all wrapped in a sleek, dark-themed GUI.

You can even run it as a standalone Windows app (.exe) thanks to PyInstaller packaging!
